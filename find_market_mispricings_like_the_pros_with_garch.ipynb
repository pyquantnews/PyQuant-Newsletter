This step is where beginners often introduce quiet-regime bias by choosing too short or too cherry-picked a window, so it’s worth being deliberate about dates."

Annualizing with 252 trading days gives a like-for-like number to compare against implied volatility or a historical annualized standard deviation. This is also where unit consistency bites beginners: because we modeled percent returns, we divide by 100 when turning the annualized figure into a decimal volatility for pricing formulas."
